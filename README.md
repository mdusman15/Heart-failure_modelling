# Heart-failure_modelling

Cardiovascular disease (CVDs) is the leading cause of death in humans around the world. It affects around 17.9 million lives each year, representing 32% of all the global deaths (Cardiovascular, 2022). Heart failure is a long term condition where the heart muscles are inadequate to pump blood to the rest of the body the way it normally should. High blood pressure, smoking and cholesterol levels are some of the key factors associated with heart failure. Machine learning can be essential in determining complex clinical characteristics of a patient’s available medical records in order to achieve better evaluations of the condition. The goal of this project is to predict heart failure patients’ survival based on the data in their medical records which will enable potential development of future studies to investigate early treatment of high-risk heart failure patients. Moreover, improved medical decision-making can also be achieved by identifying key risk factors associated with heart failure
